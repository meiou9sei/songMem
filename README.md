# SongMem

## An app to help you memorize song lyrics

- Paste your song lyrics into a form, lines separated by a newline. The algorithm automatically generates cards for you for each sentence in the song (that you can edit).
- You can then group these sentences into sections and the app will assign an emoji to them (which you can change to another emoji, or custom string).
- You can then start memorizing the song. You can display the whole line, just the first 2 words, a custom string, or hide the line entirely.
- You can change the display of whole sections of line at once. 
- In sing mode, you use the arrow keys/mouse click to go through a card at a time of sections. Sing along while looking at the cards.
- You can mark each section as "mem'd!" or "not mem'd", to know which sections to review. 
- store song lyrics you created in local storage / can export them as json files?

- light and dark modes w/ styled components

## Goal
- to practice React and styled-components with an app I'll actually use

## Later features?
- embed youtube video into site, assign timestamps to sections, and appropriate section shows in sing mode when video gets to that point? / goes back and forth if change section? can loop section over and over? idk
